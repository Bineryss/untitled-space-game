  Description: A high-capacity conduit engineered to bridge incompatible power systems
    across alien and human tech. Its flexible ferro-fiber housing protects an inner
    matrix of dynamic relays and golden-threaded control lines. On either end, adaptive
    magnetic clamps auto-tune to foreign ports, making it indispensable in jury-rigged
    builds and hybrid ship retrofits. Without it, most black-market tech would fry
    the moment it's powered up.
