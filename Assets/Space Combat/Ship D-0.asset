  Name: Temporal Fang
  Description: "The Temporal Fang is built around a stabilized Phasematter Frame,
    designed to flicker in and out of time like a strobe. Its edge surfaces ripple
    constantly, as though never fully anchored in the present. Highly agile and notoriously
    hard to hit, it appears to \u201Cteleport\u201D short distances mid-movement.\n\n"
