  Description: "The Solaris Lance is a front-line heavy assault ship built around
    a stabilized Ionseed Core matrix. Its entire hull glows with internal plasma
    circulation channels, and its energy distribution system supports up to six simultaneous
    weapon arrays. Its radiant exhaust trail makes it impossible to miss \u2014 but
    it rarely leaves survivors to see it twice."
